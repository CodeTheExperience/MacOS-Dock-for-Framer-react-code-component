### Dock Properties

| Property  | Type   | Description                                       |
|---------- |--------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `items`   | Array  | A list of objects defining dock items              |
| `width`   | Number | Defines the dock’s width (default: 400px)          |
| `height`  | Number | Defines the dock’s height (default: 80px)          |

Each item in the `items` array should follow this structure:

  "iconName": "string",
  "href": "string"
}
```

### Step-by-Step Usage

1. **Add the Dock Component**: Simply drag and drop the "macOS-Style Floating Dock" component into your Framer project.
2. **Personalize Your Dock**: Customize the dock using the properties panel:
   - Add, remove, or update dock items.
   - Use built-in icon options like `home`, `search`, `user`, `settings`, and `bell`.
   - Set custom titles and link each icon to relevant URLs.
3. **Resize as Needed**: Adjust the width and height to match your design, ensuring optimal fit and appearance.
4. **Enhance Visual Impact**: For an eye-catching effect, place the dock over a colorful or image-based background to highlight the glassmorphic effect.

### Customization Best Practices
- **Placement**: Position the dock at the bottom of the screen to mimic the traditional macOS setup.
- **Visual Variations**: Experiment with background colors, blurs, and transparency to achieve a truly unique look.
- **Extend Functionality**: Add custom icons by modifying the `iconPaths` in the component code, allowing for more flexibility.

### Performance Optimizations
- The dock is powered by **Framer Motion**, delivering highly efficient animations optimized for a smooth experience on various devices.
- For larger projects, be mindful of performance considerations by limiting the number of animated elements, ensuring seamless interactions across the board.
